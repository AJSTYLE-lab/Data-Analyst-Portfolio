# ðŸŽ“ Capstone Project (Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate)

## Dataset  
The dataset is provided by **Salifort Motors**, an automotive company. It contains employee information such as demographics, job roles, salary, tenure, performance ratings, and whether the employee has left the company (attrition).  

---

## Overview  
This Capstone Project is the final stage of the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate**.  
The project focuses on analyzing HR data to uncover patterns behind employee attrition and to build predictive models that help the company **reduce turnover** and improve workforce stability.  

---

## Problem Statement  
Employee turnover is costly and disruptive for organizations. Salifort Motors wanted to know:  
- What factors contribute most to employee attrition?  
- Can we predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company?  
- How can HR take **data-driven actions** to improve employee retention?  

---

## Objective  
- Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify key patterns in employee data.  
- Perform **statistical hypothesis testing** to validate assumptions about attrition.  
- Build and evaluate **machine learning models** to predict employee turnover.  
- Provide **actionable recommendations** to HR for reducing attrition and improving employee satisfaction.  

---

## Methods  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and standardized data, handled missing values, and encoded categorical variables.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized distributions of age, tenure, salary, job role, and attrition using Python (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`).  
- **Statistical Analysis**: Conducted chi-square tests and t-tests to determine relationships between attrition and factors such as job role, satisfaction, and tenure.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Trained and evaluated **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest Classifier** to predict employee attrition.  
- **Model Evaluation**: Measured performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC**.  
- **Tableau Dashboards**: Designed **interactive dashboards** to visualize attrition trends, department-level insights, and risk predictions.  

---

## Results  
- Identified **job role, salary, and tenure** as the most important predictors of attrition.  
- Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression, achieving **~98% accuracy and high recall** for predicting employee turnover.  
- Visual dashboards provided HR with **clear insights into high-risk departments**.  
- Developed a data-driven framework that enables HR to take proactive steps in employee retention.
